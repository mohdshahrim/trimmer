trimmer (or supposedly called splitter) is a CLI app to automate the splitting of a video file into many videos with predefined duration

you must have ffmpeg and ffprobe installed first

to run the app, use:
go run main.go [video.mp4]

you may also build the program

this is my first Golang application - expect a messy repo and code
